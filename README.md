# UAsset Converter

This extension utilizes the UAssetAPI to convert UAsset files to JSON and back all from within Visual Studio Code.

## Features

This extension provides the following features:
- Convert UAsset files to JSON
- Convert JSON files to UAsset

## Requirements

You might need .NET 8.0 or higher to run the UAssetAPI. I am not sure if this is a requirement!

## Extension Settings

There are no settings for this extension at the moment.

## Known Issues

This extension only works with UAssets that are from UE 4.27/28 due to the CLI arguments given to the UAssetAPI. This will be fixed in a future update as it is just a proof of concept and was for Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance modding.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of UAsset Converter

## To Do

- [ ] Add the ability for users to select which version of UE the UAsset is from.
- [ ] Add the ability to convert UAsset files to JSON and back in bulk (will require a revision of the CLI tool).
- [ ] Add templates for said files to appear as when converted to JSON. (i.e. a spreadsheet like view for easier editing).
